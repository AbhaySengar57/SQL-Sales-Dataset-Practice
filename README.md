# üìä SQL Practice ‚Äì Sales Dataset (MySQL Workbench)

This project is a hands-on SQL practice exercise built around a fictional **sales dataset**, designed to simulate common business analysis queries using **MySQL Workbench**.

## üìå Objective

To understand and apply fundamental SQL concepts such as:
- Data retrieval (`SELECT`)
- Filtering (`WHERE`)
- Sorting (`ORDER BY`)
- Aggregation (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Grouping (`GROUP BY`)
- Ranking (`LIMIT`)

## üîç Sample Queries

```sql
-- 1. View all records
SELECT * FROM sales_data;

-- 2. Total sales and profit by region
SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;

-- 3. Orders with negative profit
SELECT * FROM sales_data
WHERE profit < 0;

-- 4. Average sales by customer segment
SELECT segment, AVG(sales) AS avg_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY segment;

-- 5. Top 3 most profitable orders
SELECT * FROM sales_data
ORDER BY profit DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- 6. Number of orders by product category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY category;
